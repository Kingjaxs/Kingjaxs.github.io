                <p>
                    In this project, I built a simple interactive website where clicking a button displays a picture of an animal. The main goal was to practice using JavaScript to dynamically update content on a webpage, specifically by manipulating the DOM based on user interaction.

                <p>
                    This project is a personal resume webpage that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills and experience in web development by combining clean structure (HTML), visual styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript) to create an engaging and professional presentation of my background.

                <p>
                    This project was my introduction to learning HTML. The concept was a simple 'About Me' page, where I practiced using basic HTML elements to structure and present information about myself.
